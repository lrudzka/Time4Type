# Time4Type
Application for typing results of football metches.

It is my final project on the coding bootcamp at CodersLab.

It was created using React.

All used technologies: React, JavaScript, EcmaScript 2015, HTML, CSS, Sass

The application uses Fetch to get data from free football API, and also to save data in my data-base created at Firebase.

It works for the current football event, at the moment it is the World Cup 2018 Russia, next event will be Champions League 2018/2019.
